# Seismic Interpretation with Transfer and Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction
This repository implements a research project using **transfer learning** and **reinforcement learning** to automate seismic data interpretation for stratigraphic analysis. The project is designed to run in JupyterLab, with all work contained in a single notebook: `notebooks/seismic_interpretation.ipynb`.

## Project Overview
- **Motivation**: Manual seismic interpretation is slow and subjective. This project uses machine learning to improve efficiency and accuracy.
- **Research Questions**:
  - Can transfer learning classify seismic facies effectively?
  - How does it compare to traditional methods?
  - Can reinforcement learning refine interpretations?
- **Hypothesis**: Transfer learning will outperform traditional methods, with reinforcement learning adding further improvements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- JupyterLab

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seismic-interpretation.git
   cd seismic-interpretation

# Data Directory
This directory is for seismic datasets (e.g., `.segy` files). Due to size constraints, datasets are not included. Download from:
- [SEG Machine Learning Challenge Dataset](https://seg.org)
- [TerraNubis F3 Dataset](https://terranubis.com)

**Setup**:
1. Download the `.segy` files.
2. Place them in this directory (e.g., `data/seg_dataset.segy`).
