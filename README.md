# Seismic Interpretation with Transfer and Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction
This repository hosts a research project aimed at advancing seismic data interpretation for stratigraphic analysis through the integration of **transfer learning** and **reinforcement learning**. Designed to meet PhD-level standards, the project seeks to automate and enhance the traditionally slow and subjective process of interpreting seismic data, with applications in hydrocarbon exploration, geothermal energy, and carbon sequestration.

## Project Overview

### Motivation
Manual seismic interpretation is labor-intensive, prone to human error, and heavily reliant on expert knowledge. By leveraging machine learning, this project aims to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and objectivity of seismic facies classification and interpretation refinement, addressing key challenges such as large dataset handling, noise, and complex geological structures.

### Research Questions
To guide the investigation, the project poses the following refined questions:
1. To what extent can transfer learning enhance the accuracy and efficiency of seismic facies classification compared to traditional manual methods?
2. Under what conditions can reinforcement learning effectively refine seismic interpretations, and how does its performance compare to other machine learning approaches?

### Hypothesis
We hypothesize that a transfer learning approach, utilizing pre-trained models fine-tuned on seismic data, will outperform traditional interpretation methods in both speed and precision. Additionally, reinforcement learning will further improve results by iteratively refining interpretations, provided a well-designed reward system is implemented.

### Objectives
- Demonstrate the applicability of transfer learning to seismic data with limited labeled examples.
- Explore the novel use of reinforcement learning in a geophysical context.
- Provide a comprehensive comparison with traditional and alternative machine learning methods.

## Methodology
The project adopts a structured pipeline (to be implemented in a Jupyter notebook):
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Source open seismic datasets (e.g., SEG Machine Learning Challenge, TerraNubis F3).
   - Preprocess data via denoising, normalization, and conversion to suitable formats (e.g., images for CNNs).
2. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network (e.g., ResNet) for facies classification.
   - Address challenges like noisy labels using advanced techniques (e.g., label smoothing).
3. **Reinforcement Learning**:
   - Design an environment where an agent refines interpretations based on rewards tied to ground truth alignment.
   - Experiment with algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or others suited to high-dimensional data.
4. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Benchmark against traditional methods (e.g., manual interpretation) and other ML approaches (e.g., unsupervised clustering).
   - Use metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and computational efficiency.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Generate seismic sections with predicted facies overlays for validation and presentation.

#### Supporting Templates

Below are templates for key files to enhance the repository’s academic rigor and usability.

##### `data/README.md`
# Data Directory

This directory is reserved for seismic datasets (e.g., `.segy` files). Due to their size, datasets are not included in the repository.

## Obtaining Datasets
Download from:
- [SEG Machine Learning Challenge Dataset](https://seg.org) - Labeled seismic data for facies classification.
- [TerraNubis F3 Dataset](https://terranubis.com) - Open seismic dataset with geological context.

## Setup Instructions
1. Download the `.segy` files from the above sources.
2. Place them in this directory (e.g., `data/seg_dataset.segy`).
3. Optionally, add a small sample dataset to `sample_data/` for testing purposes.

## Expected Format
- Files should be in SEG-Y format, standard for seismic data.
- Accompanying metadata (e.g., inline/crossline ranges) should be documented if available.

# Theoretical Background

This document outlines the theoretical foundations of the project.

## Seismic Interpretation
Seismic data interpretation involves analyzing reflected waves to map subsurface structures. Challenges include:
- Noise from acquisition and environmental factors.
- Complexity of geological features (e.g., faults, salt bodies).

## Transfer Learning
Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet) to address data scarcity. For seismic data:
- Pre-trained CNNs can extract spatial features from image-converted seismic sections.
- Fine-tuning adapts these features to domain-specific patterns.

## Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) involves an agent learning optimal actions via rewards. In this context:
- **State**: Current interpretation (e.g., facies map).
- **Action**: Adjustments to the interpretation.
- **Reward**: Alignment with ground truth or expert feedback.

## Justification
- Transfer learning suits seismic data due to limited labeled examples.
- RL’s iterative refinement aligns with the need to correct initial predictions.
